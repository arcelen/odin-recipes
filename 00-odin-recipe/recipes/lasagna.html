<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Pasta sheets (typically made from wheat flour and eggs)</li>
    <li>Tomato-based meat sauce (usually containing ground beef or sausage)</li>
    <li>Béchamel sauce (made from butter, flour, and milk)</li>
    <li>Cheese blend (commonly mozzarella and Parmesan)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Ingredients: Gather all the necessary ingredients including pasta sheets, tomato-based meat sauce, béchamel sauce, cheese blend, and any additional ingredients like ground beef, sausage, or vegetables.</li>
    
    <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your lasagna recipe, usually around 375°F (190°C).</li>
    
    <li>Prepare the Sauces: Prepare the tomato-based meat sauce and béchamel sauce according to your preferred recipes. Cook the meat sauce until the meat is browned and the sauce is well-seasoned, and prepare the béchamel sauce by melting butter, whisking in flour, and gradually adding milk until thickened.</li>
    
    <li>Assemble the Layers: In a large baking dish, start assembling the lasagna layers. Begin with a thin layer of tomato sauce at the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking. Then, layer pasta sheets on top of the sauce, followed by a layer of meat sauce, a layer of béchamel sauce, and a sprinkle of cheese. Repeat this layering process until you've used all your ingredients, ending with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
    
    <li>Bake the Lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to trap moisture and prevent the cheese from burning. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>
    
    <li>Let it Rest: Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice and serve.</li>
    
    <li>Serve and Enjoy: Slice the lasagna into portions and serve hot. Garnish with fresh herbs like basil or parsley if desired. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
